#  Vulkan for Rust Step by Step

##  What is this?

Vulkan is hard.
Legend says it that it takes 1k lines of code for just a triangle!
Tutorials are nice and all, but if only there was some repo to ~~copy~~ *reference* code.


This this **not** a tutorial!
Rather, it is just my own exploration of Vulkan saved as a collection of commits.


FYI, this specific repo uses [`winit`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) (windowing) and [`ash`](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash) (sane Vulkan bindings).

##  Latest Commits
